# C275.CPP.Intro.Labs.2022
Solutions to C++ Intro Labs from 2022

Here are basic parameters of the contest:

1.  The instructors are the final judges and can alter the rules at any time. We will be reasonable.

2.  The contest runs from Tuesday, January 18 to Monday, February 7, 2022.

3.  Only students in CMPUT 275 are eligible for the prize.

4.  The student that shares the "best" solutions to the C++ intro labs (e.g., code) are eligible for the prize.

5.  Students have to solve at least 5 of the Kattis-based problems to be eligible.

6.  The criteria for best includes:  coding, **comments**, design, setup (e.g., makefile, input/output files)

7.  Students and TAs can nominate a winner (via a forthcoming Google Form), but the instructors will pick the winner.

8.  We will set up a Git repo for students to "submit" their solutions, and to look at the other submissions, in the coming few days.

9.  Any content put into the Git repo will be automatically licensed under GPL 3, and may be used in future years when teaching CMPUT 275.
